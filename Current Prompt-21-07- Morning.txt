I am continuing work on Module 5: React + Tailwind Frontend Integration for my Karma Astrology App.

ðŸ”§ Current Status
Frontend now built with React + Tailwind using cosmic blue & gold theme

Marriage prediction, Compatibility, Transit-Dasha components implemented

Firebase Firestore is enabled and configured (firebaseConfig.js)

Reports are saved in Firestore under:

users/{user_id}/marriageReports/{...}

users/{user_id}/compatibilityReports/{...}

/profile page shows saved reports

âœ… What I Need Next
Build TransitDasha.jsx fully

Form takes full birth info

Calls /api/transit and /api/dasha

Displays both results side-by-side

Saves report to Firestore under:
users/{user_id}/transitDashaReports/{timestamp}

Update Profile.jsx to show saved Transit+Dasha reports

Prepare final deployable GitHub project

Clean structure, remove unused files

Add .env for Firebase config

Prepare vercel.json to proxy /api/* routes

Help me deploy to Vercel

Push to GitHub

Connect to Vercel

Proxy backend API routes properly

âœ… I am a non-technical user, so please give full working files, clear folder paths, and beginner-friendly step-by-step instructions.
