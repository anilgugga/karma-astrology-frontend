Absolutely — here's a **brief and effective reminder prompt** you can use on any other computer (or after refreshing this one) to **resume right where we left off**:

### ✅ Suggested Prompt for Resuming Work Anywhere:

> \*\*“I’m developing a world-level Indian + Western astrology app using React + Firebase + FastAPI.
> We've already integrated:

1. A complete Marriage Age Prediction feature in `App.js`
2. Firebase authentication with Register, Login, and Protected Profile routes using `MainRouter.js`
3. Basic routing and UI built inside `/src`
   Now I want to fix layout responsiveness and finish connecting saved reports or enable AI chat.”\*\*

### 🧭 What We've Done So Far:

| Firebase Auth (Register/Login)   | ✅ Built and routed      |
| Profile (Protected Route)        | ✅ Functional            |
| Compatibility Page               | ✅ Working               |
