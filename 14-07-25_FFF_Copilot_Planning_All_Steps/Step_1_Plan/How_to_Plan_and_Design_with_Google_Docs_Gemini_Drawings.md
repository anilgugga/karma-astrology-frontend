# Beginner Guide: Using Google Docs & Google Drawings for Planning & Design

---

## 1. **Why Use Google Docs & Drawings?**
- **Google Docs:** Write down ideas, lists, checklists, and notes—like a digital notebook.
- **Google Drawings:** Make simple diagrams, flowcharts, or sketches of screens—like drawing on paper, but on your computer.
- **Both are 100% free, require only a Google account, and work on any computer or phone.**

## 2. **Beginner-Friendly Steps: Google Docs (for Planning & Documentation)**

### **A. How to Start a Google Doc**
1. Go to [docs.google.com](https://docs.google.com).
2. Click **Blank** (big plus sign) to start a new document.
3. Give your document a name at the top (e.g., “Astrology App Features”).

### **B. What to Write**
- **Feature List:**  
  Write a numbered or bulleted list of all the features you want (e.g., "1. Birth Chart Calculation", "2. Compatibility Report").
- **Screens List:**  
  List each screen/page you want in your app (e.g., "Home Page", "User Profile", "Prediction Results").
- **Checklist:**  
  Make checkboxes for things to do (Insert > Checkbox).
- **Notes:**  
  Write any ideas, problems, or questions as you think of them.

### **C. Organizing Docs**
- Store all your Docs in a folder ("Astrology App Planning") in your Google Drive for easy access.

## 3. **Beginner-Friendly Steps: Google Drawings (for Flowcharts & Screen Sketches)**

### **A. How to Start a Google Drawing**
1. Go to [drawings.google.com](https://drawings.google.com) (or in Docs: Insert > Drawing > New).
2. A blank canvas will open.
3. Use the tools (shapes, text boxes, lines) to draw boxes for each screen, arrows for flow, or simple layouts for how a screen should look.

### **B. What to Draw**
- **Flowchart:**  
  Show which screen goes to which (e.g., "Home" → "Birth Chart Input" → "Results").
- **Wireframe:**  
  Rough sketch of a screen—draw boxes for buttons, text, and images.

### **C. Saving & Sharing**
- Drawings are saved automatically in Google Drive.
- You can insert Drawings directly into Docs (Insert > Drawing > From Drive).

## 4. **Best AI Tool for Hand-Holding and Guidance**

### **Recommended: Google Gemini (formerly Bard) or ChatGPT Free**
- **Why:** Both are easy to use, free (for basic use), and great for:
  - Generating checklists and suggestions ("Give me a list of screens for an astrology app.")
  - Reviewing your written plans ("Is this a good feature list?")
  - Explaining technical terms in simple language.
- **How to use:**  
  - Go to [gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com) or [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com), log in, and type your question or paste your text for feedback.
- **Tip:** Ask very specific, simple questions (“What should I write on my Home Page?” or “What should my flowchart include?”).

## 5. **Checklist for Today: Review & Plan Next Steps**

### **A. Review**
- [ ] Open your Google Docs "Astrology App Features" and update with features you have already built.
- [ ] List features/screens that are still missing or incomplete.

### **B. Plan Next 2–3 Features**
- [ ] Pick the next 2–3 features you want to design/build.
- [ ] For each, make a new section in your Doc:
  - What does this feature/screen do?
  - What information/fields/buttons does it need?
  - (Optional) Sketch a wireframe in Google Drawings and insert it.

### **C. Next Steps**
- [ ] Use your checklist to guide tomorrow’s work in ReactJS.
- [ ] If stuck, ask Gemini or ChatGPT for step-by-step help.
