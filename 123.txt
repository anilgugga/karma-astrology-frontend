I am building Module 5: React + Tailwind Frontend Integration for my Karma Astrology App.

Current Status:
Backend: Fully ready with:

predict_marriage_age_single() using .joblib model

Compatibility logic and AI explanation already in astro_logic.py

Frontend: I want to upgrade from standalone HTML to React + Tailwind using the same cosmic blue & gold theme.

2️⃣ Project Structure & Boilerplate
Please give me the complete project structure with:

package.json

tailwind.config.js

postcss.config.js

src/index.css

All components pre-built

3️⃣ API Integration
Each React component must:

Use fetch() or axios to call my backend endpoints

Display the results properly with cosmic blue & gold theme

Include input forms with proper Tailwind styling

4️⃣ Deployment Preparation
