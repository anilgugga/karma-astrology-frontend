Here’s a prompt you can copy-paste into our next session to pick up exactly where we left off:

Prompt for Next Session:
Hi ChatGPT, continuing work on my full-stack AI astrology app.

Summary of Progress So Far:
✅ Completed:

Added JWT-authenticated Birth Details Input Form

Integrated BirthChart.js with cosmic blue/gold UI matching uploaded files

Displaying planet positions, ascendant, and houses

Prepared North/South Indian chart placeholders

Maintained consistent visual style from previous HTML prototypes (color palette, card design, buttons, etc.)

What We Need to Do Next:
Top Priority:

1️⃣ Generate North Indian & South Indian chart SVG components

Use NorthIndianChart.js and SouthIndianChart.js

Match the deep blue + gold style, rounded borders, hover interactions optional

Accept houses and planets as props for dynamic rendering

2️⃣ Implement PDF Export + Share Functionality

Use html2canvas + jspdf

Export the chart tables + SVG diagrams into a clean, branded PDF

Add "Download Report" and "Share Chart" buttons

Ensure the PDF follows the same visual theme

3️⃣ Build a Full Natal Chart Report Module

Assemble planet data, houses, SVG charts, metadata into one exportable report

Optionally add future expansion points like transit reports or dasha predictions

Remind me of this summary when starting the next session.
